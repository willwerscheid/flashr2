\title{zero out a factor from f}
\usage{
flash_zero_out_factor(data, f, k = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a flash data object}

\item{f}{a flash fit object}

\item{k}{index of factor/loading to zero out}
}
\description{
zero out a factor from f
}
\details{
The factor and loadings of the kth factor of f are made to be zero
(except for elements of the factor/loading that are designated to be fixed).
This effectively reduces the rank by 1, although the zero factor/loading is kept in f
so the number and indexing of factor/loading matrices in f remains the same.
