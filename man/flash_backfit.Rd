\title{Refines a fit of the flash model to data by "backfitting"}
\usage{
flash_backfit(data, f_init, kset = NULL, var_type = c("by_column",
  "constant"), tol = 0.01, ebnm_fn = ebnm_pn,
  ebnm_param = flash_default_ebnm_param(ebnm_fn), verbose = FALSE,
  nullcheck = TRUE, maxiter = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{an n by p matrix or a flash data object created using \code{flash_set_data}}

\item{f_init}{a fitted flash object to be refined}

\item{kset}{the indices of factors to be optimized (NULL indicates all factors)}

\item{var_type}{type of variance structure to assume for residuals.}

\item{tol}{specify how much objective can change in a single iteration to be considered not converged}

\item{ebnm_fn}{function to solve the Empirical Bayes Normal Means problem}

\item{ebnm_param}{named list containing parameters to be passed to ebnm_fn when optimizing; defaults set by flash_default_ebnm_param()}

\item{verbose}{if TRUE various output progress updates will be printed}

\item{nullcheck}{flag whether to check, after running
hill-climbing updates, whether the achieved optimum is better than setting factor to 0.
If this check is performed and fails then the factor will be set to 0 in the returned fit.}

\item{maxiter}{a maximum number of iterations to perform (in the inner loop). To perform just one iteration we suggest setting maxiter=1 and nullcheck=FALSE}
}
\value{
a fitted flash object
}
\description{
Refines a fit of the flash model to data by "backfitting"
}
\details{
Iterates through the factors of a flash object, updating each until convergence

\examples{
Y = matrix(rnorm(100),nrow=5,ncol=20)
fg = flash_add_greedy(Y,10)
fb = flash_backfit(Y,fg) # refines fit from greedy by backfitting
fsi = flash_init_fn(flash_set_data(Y),"udv_si",4)
fb2 = flash_backfit(Y,fsi)
