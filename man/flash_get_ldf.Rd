\title{flash_get_ldf}
\usage{
flash_get_ldf(f, k = NULL, drop_zero_factors = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{a flash fit object}

\item{k}{indices of loadings/factors to be returned}

\item{drop_zero_factors}{flag whether to remove any factor/loadings that are zero}
}
\value{
a list with elements
\itemize{
\item{l} a matrix whose columns contain the standardized loadings (ie norm 1)
\item{d} a vector of weights (analogous to the singular values in an svd)
\item{f} a matrix whose columns contain the standardized factors (ie norm 1)
}
These are analogous to the u, d and v returned by \code{svd}, but columns of l and f are not orthogonal.
