\arguments{
\item{R}{an n times p matrix of data (expected residuals)}

\item{R2}{an n times p matrix of expected squared residuals}

\item{l_init}{the initial value of loading used for iterative scheme (n vector)}

\item{f_init}{the initial value of the factor for iterative scheme (p vector)}

\item{l2_init}{initial value of l2 (optional)}

\item{f2_init}{initial value of f2 (optional)}

\item{l_subset}{vector of indices of l to update (default is all)}

\item{f_subset}{vector of indices of f to update (default is all)}

\item{ebnm_fn}{function to solve the Empirical Bayes normal means problem}

\item{ebnm_param}{parameters to be passed to ebnm_fn when optimizing}

\item{var_type}{the type of variance structure to assume}

\item{tol}{a tolerance on changes in l and f to diagnose convergence}

\item{calc_F}{whether to compute the objective function (useful for testing purposes)}

\item{missing}{an n times matrix of TRUE/FALSE indicating which elements of R and R2 should be considered missing (note neither R nor R2 must have missing values; eg set them to 0)}

\item{verbose}{if true then trace of objective function is printed}

\item{maxiter}{an upper bound on the number of iterations before terminating}

\item{KLobj}{the value of the KL part of the objective for the other factors not being optimized (optional, but allows objective to be computed accurately)}

\value{
an updated flash object

\description{
Optimize a single loading and factor ('rank 1' model)
}
\details{
This function iteratively optimizes the loading, factor and residual precision, from residuals and their expected squared values
Currently the tolerance is on the changes in l and f (not on the objective function)
